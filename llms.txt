> Parallel agentic development framework for Claude Code

claude-corps provides skills, agents, hooks, and scripts that extend Claude Code (Anthropic's agentic coding CLI) into an autonomous multi-session development team. Multiple Claude agents work simultaneously in isolated git worktrees, coordinated by an orchestrator that dispatches tasks, reconciles results, and compounds learnings across sessions.

## Key Capabilities

- /dispatch: Spawn parallel agent teammates via Agent Teams, each in an isolated git worktree
- /auto-run: Autonomous multi-hour orchestration loop (dispatch, reconcile, repeat)
- /spec: Research-driven planning with parallel agents — interactive refinement, plan writing, task decomposition. Use --deepen to enhance an existing plan with parallel research
- /orient: Survey a project and identify parallel work streams
- /start-task: Claim a task, create a worktree, gather context, define acceptance criteria
- /finish-task: Tests, commit, PR, code review, session summary, close
- /compound: Capture learnings for future sessions (compound engineering)
- /multi-review: Parallel specialized code review with 11 agent types (including framework-specific reviewers for Next.js, Tailwind/shadcn, and Python backend)
- Review configuration: Per-project .claude/review.json for review depth, reviewer overrides, and smart model selection (Opus for critical/high, Sonnet for medium/low)

## Architecture

Orchestrator + Workers pattern. One Claude session orients and dispatches work via Agent Teams.
Worker sessions execute tasks in isolated git worktrees and report back with session summaries.
The orchestrator reconciles results, updates the task board, and dispatches newly unblocked work.
